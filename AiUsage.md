# AI Usage Documentation

## Overview
This document details the use of AI tools in developing the Logos Stories project.

### Rational
Normally, courses for credit at an academic institution do not encourage the use of generative AI tools for code development.
However, the use of AI tools in this project was approved by the course instructor, Dr. Derrick Tate.
The following considerations were made when deciding to use Ai:
- I need to be able to understand the code in order to use Ai effectively in the first place.
- Ai is an incredibly fast programmer when guided right. This project is a solo project and I have a limited amount of time to complete it.
- This project is an implementation of research ideas, and the goal is to complete the research, not know how to implement the project (although that is a good secondary goal.)
- The Ai tools used are not black boxes. They are tools that I have used before and understand how they work.
- Much of the code is then manually edited by me to improve it and match the project's requirements or remove bugs.

## AI Tools Used
- Claude.ai
- GitHub Copilot

## Scope of AI Assistance

### Code Generation
- AI was used to generate code at many points in this project, from setting up the project to implementing specific features.
- Specific instructions were hand-written and then the prompt was carefully crafted to guide the AI to generate the desired code.
- Specific areas include the debug logger, some testing, handling story templating, and middleware implementation.

### Code Suggestions
- AI tools provided code completion and suggestions during development.
- Many of these suggestions were ignored, as they were not relevant to the project or were not the best way to implement the feature.
- Focus areas included error handling patterns and refactoring implementations.

### Frontend Development
- AI contributed significantly to frontend template generation
- Generated frontend code required substantial modification and debugging
- Final implementation maintains proper separation of concerns and follows best practices

## Human Oversight
All AI-generated content was:
- Reviewed for correctness and efficiency
- Modified to match project requirements
- Tested where possible.
- Integrated thoughtfully into the existing codebase

The final product represents a collaborative effort between AI assistance and human expertise, with all key architectural and design decisions made by the human developer.
The author would like to thank the companies behind the AI tools used in this project for allowing him to use their tools, often free of charge.
